Consider a matrix where each cell contains either a  or a . Any cell containing a  is called a filled cell. Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In the following grid, all cells marked X are connected to the cell marked Y.

XYX  
XXX    
If one or more filled cells are also connected, they form a region. Note that each cell in a region is connected to zero or more cells in the region but is not necessarily directly connected to all the other cells in the region.

Given an  matrix, find and print the number of cells in the largest region in the matrix. Note that there may be more than one region in the matrix.

For example, there are two regions in the following  matrix. The larger region at the top left contains  cells. The smaller one at the bottom right contains .
