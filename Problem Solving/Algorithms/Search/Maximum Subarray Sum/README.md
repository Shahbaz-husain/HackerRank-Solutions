We define the following:

A subarray of array  of length  is a contiguous segment from  through  where .
The sum of an array is the sum of its elements.
Given an  element array of integers, , and an integer, , determine the maximum value of the sum of any of its subarrays modulo .

Example


The following table lists all subarrays and their moduli:

		sum	%2
[1]		1	1
[2]		2	0
[3]		3	1
[1,2]		3	1
[2,3]		5	1
[1,2,3]		6	0
The maximum modulus is .

Function Description

Complete the maximumSum function in the editor below.

maximumSum has the following parameter(s):

long a[n]: the array to analyze
long m: the modulo divisor
Returns
- long: the maximum (subarray sum modulo )

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries to perform.

The next  pairs of lines are as follows:

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and (long), the length of  and the modulo divisor.
The second line contains  space-separated long integers .
Constraints

 the sum of  over all test cases

Explanation

The subarrays of array  and their respective sums modulo  are ranked in order of length and sum in the following list:

 and 
 and 






The maximum value for  for any subarray is .
