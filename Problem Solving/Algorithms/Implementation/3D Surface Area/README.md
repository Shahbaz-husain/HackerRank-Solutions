The object is rotated so the front row matches column 1 of the input, heights 1, 2, and 1.

The front face is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 units in area.
The top is 3 units.
The sides are 4 units.
None of the rear faces are exposed.
The underside is 3 units.
The front row contributes 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 14 units to the surface area.
