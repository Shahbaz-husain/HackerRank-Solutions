We define  to be a permutation of the first  natural numbers in the range . Let  denote the value at position  in permutation  using -based indexing.

 is considered to be an absolute permutation if  holds true for every .

Given  and , print the lexicographically smallest absolute permutation . If no absolute permutation exists, print -1.

Example


Create an array of elements from  to , . Using  based indexing, create a permutation where every . It can be rearranged to  so that all of the absolute differences equal :

pos[i]  i   |pos[i] - i|
  3     1        2
  4     2        2
  1     3        2
  2     4        2
Function Description

Complete the absolutePermutation function in the editor below.

absolutePermutation has the following parameter(s):

int n: the upper bound of natural numbers to consider, inclusive
int k: the absolute difference between each element's value and its index
Returns

int[n]: the lexicographically smallest permutation, or  if there is none
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.
Each of the next  lines contains  space-separated integers,  and .

Constraints

Sample Input

STDIN   Function
-----   --------
3       t = 3 (number of queries)
2 1     n = 2, k = 1
3 0     n = 3, k = 0
3 2     n = 3, k = 2
Sample Output

2 1
1 2 3
-1

Test Case 1:

perm(1).png

Test Case 2:
No absolute permutation exists, so we print -1 on a new line.
