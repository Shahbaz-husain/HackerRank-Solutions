A numeric string, , is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of two or more positive integers, , satisfying the following conditions:

 for any  (i.e., each element in the sequence is  more than the previous element).
No  contains a leading zero. For example, we can split  into the sequence , but it is not beautiful because  and  have leading zeroes.
The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged. For example, we can split  into the sequence , but it is not beautiful because it breaks our first constraint (i.e., ).
The diagram below depicts some beautiful strings:

Perform  queries where each query consists of some integer string . For each query, print whether or not the string is beautiful on a new line. If it is beautiful, print YES x, where  is the first number of the increasing sequence. If there are multiple such values of , choose the smallest. Otherwise, print NO.

Function Description

separateNumbers has the following parameter:

s: an integer value represented as a string
Prints
- string: Print a string as described above. Return nothing.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of strings to evaluate.
Each of the next  lines contains an integer string  to query.

The first three numbers are beautiful (see the diagram above). The remaining numbers are not beautiful:

For , all possible splits violate the first and/or second conditions.
For , it starts with a zero so all possible splits violate the second condition.
For , the only possible split is , which violates the first condition.
For , there are no possible splits because  only has one digit.
