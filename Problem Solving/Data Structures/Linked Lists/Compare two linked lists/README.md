Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

Example
 references the list 

Manipulate the  pointers of each node in place and return , now referencing the head of the list .

Function Description

Complete the reverse function in the editor below.

reverse has the following parameter:

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the reversed list
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following format:

The first line contains an integer , the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next  lines contains an integer, the  values of the elements in the linked list.

ConstraintsYou’re given the pointer to the head nodes of two linked lists. Compare the data in the nodes of the linked lists to check if they are equal. If all data attributes are equal and the lists are the same length, return . Otherwise, return .

Example



The two lists have equal data attributes for the first  nodes.  is longer, though, so the lists are not equal. Return .

Function Description

Complete the compare_lists function in the editor below.

compare_lists has the following parameters:

SinglyLinkedListNode llist1: a reference to the head of a list
SinglyLinkedListNode llist2: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

int: return 1 if the lists are equal, or 0 otherwise
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of test cases.

Each of the test cases has the following format:
The first line contains an integer , the number of nodes in the first linked list.
Each of the next  lines contains an integer, each a value for a data attribute.
The next line contains an integer , the number of nodes in the second linked list.
Each of the next  lines contains an integer, each a value for a data attribute.

Constraints

Output Format

Compare the two linked lists and return 1 if the lists are equal. Otherwise, return 0. Do NOT print anything to stdout/console.

The output is handled by the code in the editor and it is as follows:

For each test case, in a new line, print  if the two lists are equal, else print .

Explanation

There are  test cases, each with a pair of linked lists.

In the first case, linked lists are: 1 -> 2 -> NULL and 1 -> NULL

In the second case, linked lists are: 1 -> 2 -> NULL and 1 -> 2 -> NULL

, where  is the  element in the list.

Explanation

The initial linked list is: .

The reversed linked list is: .
